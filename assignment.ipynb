    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "We have now worked with Python with the `pandas` library to learn about `DataFrame`s and `geopandas` to learn about `GeoDataFrame`s by following some basic tutorials. This next assignment will use the toy `nybb` database that is popular in the open source software world to work with `geopandas` more exploratively. More specifcially, we will be reproducing some output that we previously did in the QGIS Tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read this [tutorial](https://geopandas.org/getting_started/introduction.html)\n",
    "Browse/read the GeoPandas [user guide](https://geopandas.org/docs/user_guide.html).\n",

    "#### Geospatial libraries and notes on documentation \n",
    "Geospatial Library Reference:\n",
    "- [Shapely docs](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html)\n",
    "- [Geopanda docs](http://geopandas.org/)\n",
    "- [Pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html#user-guide)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docs can be good or bad. The docs for above range from \"ok\" to \"good\". It helps to have a working knowledge of `pandas` but the docs for `pandas` are quite good for learning and as a reference. `geopandas` actually uses the `shapely` model for geometries and while it needs to be installed, there is little direct interaction with this library on our part except for accessing the `shapely` geometries.\n",
